### Installation

Once you've cloned the code and repository, follow the following commands in the CLI

- Navigate to the root of the functions folder and run `npm install`
- Navigate back to the root of the entire project and run `firebase serve --only functions`

This runs the development server for the frontend which is in a seperate folder

#test
